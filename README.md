***To do:***
1. Make sure exits and enters are stored
2. Potentially change relative frequency of probes. They can occur basically right after each other at this point
3. Potentially introduce static if there is an issue with the last trial
4. Potentially change questions if we can come up with better ones
5. Update instructions
6. Make mouse dissapear during trials
